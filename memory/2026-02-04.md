# 2026-02-04 (Wednesday) - Knowledge Migration Day 📦

## Mission: Aries Backup → QMD Memory System Migration

### Source
**Location:** ~/Desktop/Aries/
**Backup Date:** 2026-02-03 16:40 GMT+4
**Contents:** 50+ files including project docs, analysis reports, memory files

### Migration Completed

**Core Files Migrated:**
- MEMORY.md - Consolidated and updated with archive context
- SOUL.md - AI personality and behavior principles
- USER.md - About Lenny (context and preferences)
- TOOLS.md - Local environment notes
- IDENTITY.md - Aries AI identity

**Daily Memory:**
- memory/2026-02-03.md - Massive progress day documentation

### Key Knowledge Extracted

**Systems Built (2026-02-03):**
- Nexus Agent at localhost:8081 (dual-model, security issues)
- Hybrid Kanban at localhost:3001 (React/Vite/Lovable)
- Simple Dashboard at localhost:8082 (custom HTML/JS)
- Telegram Bot @AriesAssistBot (operational)
- 47+ sub-agents created for various tasks

**Research Completed:**
- ICT (Inner Circle Trader) methodology - comprehensive trading framework
- Qullamaggie strategy - 268% CAGR momentum trading
- SEOF - Skill Embedding & Operationalization Framework
- Nexus capability analysis - 26 gaps, $175K/28-week roadmap

**Architecture Patterns Preserved:**
- Multi-angle knowledge framework (5-source validation)
- Sub-agent orchestration methodology
- Context compaction protocol
- Multi-layer resilience engineering
- File-based backend design

**Lessons Documented:**
- Context management (document before cleanup)
- Simplicity-first development
- Design change safety protocols
- AI-first vs traditional cost comparison ($0 vs $800K)

### Files NOT Migrated (Intentionally)

**Too Technical/Dated:**
- IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (35KB) - Veritas-specific, outdated
- integration-architecture.md (24KB) - Code-heavy, reference only
- monitoring-extensions-spec.md (32KB) - Detailed specs, archive

**Reference Only (in backup if needed):**
- analysis-reports/ folder - Nexus technical analysis
- skills-framework-implementation.md
- knowledge-library-architecture.md
- evidence-synthesis-system.md

**Security Sensitive:**
- auth-profiles.json
- openclaw.json

### Migration Statistics

| Category | Files | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Core Memory | 5 | ✅ Migrated |
| Daily Files | 1 | ✅ Migrated |

### Backup Location Reference

If detailed specs needed, original files at:
```
~/Desktop/Aries/
├── PROJECT_STATUS.md
├── SYSTEMS_INVENTORY.md
├── DEVELOPMENT_SNAPSHOT.md
├── analysis-reports/
│   ├── TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md

```

### Next Steps

1. **Verify QMD indexing** - Ensure memory files are searchable
2. **Test knowledge retrieval** - Query migrated insights
3. **Archive cleanup** - Consider moving Aries backup to cold storage
4. **Fresh start** - New session with full historical context
