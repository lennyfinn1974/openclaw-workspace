# Master Command Architecture Research Summary - 2026-02-05

## 🎯 CRITICAL DECISION: Hybrid "Sovereign Command Architecture"

**Combining:**
1. **Option 3 Hierarchical Master Command System** (from our research)
2. **Sovereign AI Workspace Active Memory** (from other developers)

## MASTER COMMAND STRUCTURE

### Tier 1 Commands (Local Model: qwen2.5:7b - FREE)
- `SYS` - System status and health monitoring
- `HBT` - Heartbeat/proactive maintenance  
- `MEM` - Memory search and retrieval
- `STS` - Context and session information
- `CLN` - Routine cleanup operations

### Tier 2 Commands (Development: deepseek - 7x cheaper)
- `BLD` - CodeBuilder.md workflow execution
- `DEV` - Development task coordination
- `TST` - Testing and validation workflows
- `DPL` - Deployment pipeline execution
- `FIX` - Debugging and problem resolution

### Tier 3 Commands (Premium: sonnet/opus - when needed)
- `ANZ` - Deep analysis and research
- `STR` - Strategic planning and architecture
- `SYN` - Complex information compilation
- `DEC` - Critical decision support
- `ARC` - System architecture design

## KEY ARCHITECTURE FEATURES

### Memory System (from Sovereign AI Workspace)
- **Hybrid Structure:** JSONL (short-term) + Markdown (long-term)
- **Active Self-Updating:** Agent writes its own memory
- **Hybrid Search:** Vector embeddings + SQLite FTS5
- **Trigger-Based Updates:** Time/event consolidation

### Command Execution (from Option 3)
- **Compressed Workflows:** Pre-compiled patterns
- **Smart Model Routing:** Automatic tier selection
- **Context Protection:** Auto-compaction at 70%
- **State Preservation:** Zero-interruption handoffs

## EXPECTED IMPACT
- **Context Efficiency:** 90% reduction in usage
- **Cost Savings:** 80% reduction ($525→$60/month)
- **Speed:** 3-5 minutes → 5-15 seconds
- **Memory:** Zero hallucination, perfect recall

## TODAY'S KEY LEARNINGS
1. Context filled despite monitoring - need proactive management
2. Terminal control complexity - interrupted active processes
3. Skills forgotten under pressure - need forced compliance
4. Memory timeouts (QMD) - need hybrid approach
5. Cost drift - started optimized, degraded over time

## IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY
Week 1: Core tier system + model routing
Week 2: Memory fragment system  
Week 3: Production optimization
