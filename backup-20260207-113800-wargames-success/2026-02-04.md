# 2026-02-04 - Power Outage Recovery & Gateway Monitoring

## Power Outage Event
**19:47 GMT+4** - Unexpected power loss
- Gateway PID changed: 59047 → 906 (auto-restart successful)
- LaunchAgent service worked perfectly - no manual intervention needed
- OpenClaw core came back online automatically

## Gateway Monitoring System Deployed (Pre-outage)
Successfully implemented complete protection system:

### Multi-Layer Protection Active:
- **Gateway Health Monitor**: Every 10 minutes (cron job active)
- **System Maintenance**: Every hour (cron job active) 
- **Process monitoring scripts**: `./scripts/gateway-monitor.sh`, `./scripts/auto-restart-gateway.py`
- **Config enabled**: `commands.restart: true` 

### Auto-Restart Triggers:
- Gateway RPC probe failure → Immediate restart
- Process death → Immediate restart
- 3+ EPIPE errors/hour → Preemptive restart
- Memory system failures → Failover to builtin

## Post-Outage Status
✅ Gateway: Operational (PID 906)
✅ Cron jobs: All preserved and scheduled
✅ Health monitoring: Active
⚠️ Memory system: Still showing QMD timeout issues
🟡 Local services: Need manual restart (Kanban, Nexus, Dashboard)

## Lessons Learned
- LaunchAgent resilience works perfectly for core services
- Cron jobs survive power outages (good design)
- Local development servers need manual attention
- Monitoring system provides valuable pre/post outage context

**Power infrastructure reliability**: Consider UPS for development environment
