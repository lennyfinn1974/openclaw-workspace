## Core Architecture Patterns

### Multi-Angle Knowledge Framework
Never rely on single information source - cross-validate everything:
1. **Personal Context:** MEMORY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md files
2. **Project Intelligence:** README.md, requirements, specifications
3. **External Research:** Web search, documentation deep-dives
4. **Real-Time Data:** API integration, live monitoring
5. **Historical Patterns:** Memory files, decision logs, lessons learned

### Sub-Agent Orchestration
**Specialized agents for different thinking styles:**
- **Technical Architecture:** System specifications, detailed design
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Implementation focus, quick iteration
- **Deep Analysis:** Mathematical/analytical work
- **User Experience:** Conversational design, UX

**Master Pattern:** Focused expertise > generalist approach (prevents context overflow)

### Multi-Layer Resilience
- Gateway-level health monitoring (cron every 10-30m)
- Sub-agent task isolation for heavy work
- Context threshold monitoring (70% warnings)
- Memory preservation through structured documentation
- Compaction protocol as final failsafe

---

## Key Lessons Learned

### Context Management
- **Document before cleanup** - pre-compaction documentation is critical
- **"New Session" ≠ Full compaction** - knowledge preservation requires explicit action
- **134k→8k tokens** successful compaction achieved through proper protocol
- **Daily → Weekly → Monthly** rollup pattern for memory consolidation

### Development Philosophy
- **Simplicity-First:** Sometimes building from scratch faster than fixing dependencies
- **Custom vs Complex:** Lean HTML/JS beats heavy frameworks for simple needs
- **File-based backends > complex databases** for local-first systems
- **Minimal viable approach first** - add complexity only when necessary

### Design Change Safety
- **Always backup working systems** before applying changes
- **Staged deployment with rollback capability** is essential
- **SuperDesign skill caused problems** - powerful tools need careful use
- **Iterative testing** - make small changes and verify before proceeding

### Resilience Engineering
- Session crashes don't kill the system
- Health monitoring catches problems early
- Sub-agents provide task isolation
- Memory systems preserve knowledge continuity

**Timeline:** 11:00-11:19 GMT+4 | **Achievement:** First working Claude Code terminal automation

**🔧 CRITICAL TECHNICAL DISCOVERY:**

**The Enter Key Revelation:**
- **Execute Command**: `osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal" to do script "" in window id [ID]'` *(empty string)*
- **Line Break Only**: `osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal" to do script return in window id [ID]'` *(just newline)*

**Impact:** This single distinction enabled all subsequent automation success

### Working Permission Prompt Protocol
```bash
# Step 1: Send option selection  
osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal" to do script "1" in window id [ID]'

# Step 2: Execute selection (CRITICAL!)
osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal" to do script "" in window id [ID]'
```

**Permission Prompt Pattern:**
```
Do you want to proceed?
